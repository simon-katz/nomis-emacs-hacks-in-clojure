# emacs-hacks-in-clojure

**DEPRECATED — The functionality has been moved to my Emacs init files.**

Functions written in Clojure intended for use from Emacs by sending
forms for evaluation to a Clojure REPL and processing the results in
Emacs. Do cool things without learning lots about Emacs Lisp.
